        <h2>Hello, My name is Tomer Itzkovitch</h2>
      </div>
      <p class="AboutMe">
        A 16 year old front end developer with a passion for coding and a love
        for Muay Thai. Hailing from the picturesque kibbutz of Ein Harod in
        Israel.
        <br />
        Growing up in Ein Harod has instilled in me a deep appreciation for
        community, hard work, and the beautiful landscape of Israel. <br />
        As a young developer, I'm on a journey to expand my skills in front-end
        engineering, <br />
        all while carrying the spirit of collective living and shared
        responsibilities that kibbutz life embodies. <br />
        When I'm not immersed in coding projects or sharpening my Muay Thai
        skills, I find solace in the rich history and cultural heritage of
        Israel.
        <br />
        It's a place where past and present seamlessly intertwine, and I'm proud
        to call it home. <br />
        As I continue to explore the boundless possibilities in both the tech
        world and the world of martial arts, <br />
        I hope to draw inspiration from the unique experiences and values that
        my upbringing in Ein Harod has provided. <br />
        Thank you for taking the time to learn more about me, my passions, and
        the place I call home.
